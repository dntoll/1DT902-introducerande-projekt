# Blink External LED's

## Goals
To work with input
To work with sound

## Rules

This task is going to be conducted in a group of two students. Both students must be active during all steps of the assignment.

During the assignment you may discuss the assignment with students outside the group. You may help other groups but you may NOT do all steps for them. Note that these rules change between assignments.
