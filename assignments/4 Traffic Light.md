# The Traffic Light

## Goals
To work with more code and more components.

## Rules

This task is going to be conducted in a group of two students. Both students must be active during all steps of the assignment.

During the assignment you may discuss the assignment with students outside the group. 
You may help other groups but you may NOT do all steps for them, or share any code. Note that these rules change between assignments.

## Knowledge Components


## Ingredients

### Hardware
 One traffic light component.
 
 
 
## Steps


### Step 1. Check all components

Individually step through all the components so that they can be individually. 

Write a routine that waits for a button press, then lights up each LED and then beeps the buzzer before continuing.


### Step 2. Traffic light with pedestrian crossing
Implement an algorithm for running a pedestrian crossing light. The traffic light has six LED's (Red, yellow, green, Red, Green, yellow), a button, and a buzzer. The button should represent a pedestrian wanting to cross the street, when pressed the yellow button LED should light up. 

States:
 * Traffic Get ready: Traffic Green + Yellow, Pedestrian Red, 1 second
 * Traffic Go: Traffic Green, Pedestrian Red, 4 seconds but continue longer if not interrupted
 * Traffic Soon stop: Traffic Yellow, Pedestrian Red, 2 seconds
 * All stop: Traffic Red, Pedestrian Red, 1 second
 * Pedestrian Go: Traffic Red, Pedestrian Green, Speedy Tick sounds, 3 seconds
 * Pedestrian Soon Stop: Traffic Red, Pedestrian Green, Slower Tick Sounds, 1 second
 
 
 ### Step 3. Communicating Traffic lights
