# Example project

This is an example project to have something to start from as well as being the default project. 
In its current from the project should only be awarded with passing grade, for higher grades you need to add more features, or do a completely custom project.


## The four way crossing
Using the knowledge given in the previous assignments build a four way crossing (two crossing roads) both with traffic lights and pedestrian crossings.

When no pedestrians are available the traffic interpolate between the two roads. 
When a pedestrian button is pressed the pedestrian light will give access to only the pedestrians for a time-period.
The two traffic lights should communicate so that they share state and synchronize.
