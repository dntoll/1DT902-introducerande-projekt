This is a small programming project.

## Rules

 * 

## Requirements

The programming project should contain.
 * Pycom devices from two groups
 * Additional hardware (For example sensors, buttons, LED's, Buzzers etc...)
 * Some cloud connection
 
 
 ## Deliverables
 
 Git repository link with git-history ( With at least one commit per group gathering )
 You are to deliver everything needed to complete the project
 
 Project documentation on git in a /doc folder. Written in markdown.
  * timelog.md --- A log of group-gatherings, date, record of who attended, time spent, and a short note on the focus of the gatherings.
    * Ex. 2020-10-10, Daniel and Morgan, 2 hours, set up breadboard and tested components.
  * requirements.md --- Project requirements (feature-lists, or user-stories (https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) with enough detail so that one can read this and understand what the project is and does.
  * hardware.md --- A description of all hardware components and how to connect them. Take a couple of images.
  * setup.md --- A description of the software components and how to set them up. Dont forget external resources such as Adafruit IO and how to setup and adopt your project to this. 
  * test.md --- A description on how to test the project. Write a short descriptive text on how to run each of the features and
  
 Project source on git in a /src folder.

## Presentation

In a group you are to present your project. The presentation is setup in the following way.
 * 5 minutes, prepare hardware for presentation, final tests
 * Present the project as a 30 seconds elevator pitch. This needs to be prepared and rehearsed multiple times. A supershort presentation of the group, some background of the project, and what the project does. 
 * 5 minutes demo of the project, show the most important features
 * Clear the space for next group
 
### Examination

Deliverables
 * Ok --- Students have everything asked for under deliverables
 * Good --- Students have a clear understandable deliverables with a good structure (headlines, tables etc). Git-history shows progressive work.
 * Excellent --- Everything delivered is polished, time is spent on details. Git shows usage of branches and merges. 
 
Sourcecode
 * Ok --- Students have submitted code in a repository, nothing is plagiarized.
 * Good --- Clear readable sourcecode with methods that follows code standard. Little code duplication. 
 * Excellent --- Good naming of methods. Code divided into classes/methods/libraries and in files. 
 
Project size and complexity
 * Ok --- Students have set a set of requirements and implemented most of those such as in the example project.
 * Good --- Students have deviced their own set of requirements and implemented and tested those.
 * Excellent --- The project does complex things, or contains a lot of requirements or much code. Proejct is well tested. Amaze us!
