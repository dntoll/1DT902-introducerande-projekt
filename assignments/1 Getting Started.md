# Getting started

## Introduction

## Goals
 * Connect hardware 
 * Install Atom and pymkr plugin
 * Connect to board in Atom and run code in console (on the hardware)
 * Upload files and run code on the microcontroller

## Rules
This task is going to be conducted in a group of two students. 
During the assignment you may discuss the assignment with students outside the group. 
You may help other groups but you may NOT do all steps for them.
Note that these rules change between assignments.

The assingment is done when you have show

The deadline is ...
